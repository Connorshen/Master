 abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of teaching鈥搇earning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm for the first time in modeling stream dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction. The input parameters selected from a surface water-quality study including 20 indicators for the models are water pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, and hardness, which were measured semimonthly at six monitoring sites selected in an untreated wastewater impacted urban stream during a year, due to their direct and indirect effect on DO concentration. The accuracy of TLBO method is compared with those of the artificial bee colony algorithm and conventional regression analysis methods. These methods are applied to four different regression forms: quadratic, exponential, linear, and power. There are 144 data for each water-quality indicator, 114 of which are designated for training and the rest for testing patterns in the models. To evaluate the performance of the models, five statistical indices, i.e., sum square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, average relative error, and determination coefficient, are used. The TLBO method with quadratic form from among all models yielded better prediction, with an improvement of nearly 20聽%. It can be concluded that the equations obtained by employing the TLBO algorithms predict the stream DO concentration successfully. Therefore, the employment of the TLBO algorithm by water resources and environment managers is encouraged and recommended for future studies.},

 abstract={The existing combination method for water quality prediction lacks of a framework approach and the probability prediction is always based on an assumption that water quality index follows certain probability distribution. A new method based on probability-combination for water quality prediction was proposed. The method combined the prediction results of different single methods through the use of Odds-Matrix method and it could improve the performances of prediction effectively. It was worth noting that the combination-forecast approach could be extended to new methods. The probability of prediction was established through statistical analysis of historical prediction data and hence the validation of the method was achieved along with interval estimation under certain confidence level. The Probability-Combination method based on gray model group and exponent smoothing was proposed for Jiukengkou, Zhejiang. Experimental results indicated that the combination-forecast approach performs better than single prediction method. The validity of probability establishment could be checked effectively. According to the results, the envelopes of water-quality curve under certain confidence level were derived. The prediction accuracy and stability could be improved effectively and probability results which could be the basis of the decision-making could also be given successfully by probability-combination. Furthermore, as a framework approach, it could add new prediction methods continuously.},

 abstract={AbstractThe term 鈥渨ater quality鈥 is used to describe the condition of water, including its chemical, physical, and biological characteristics. Modeling water quality parameters is a very important aspect in the analysis of any aquatic systems. Prediction of surface water quality is required for proper management of the river basin so that adequate measure can be taken to keep pollution within permissible limits. Accurate prediction of future phenomena is the life blood of optimal water resources management. The artificial neural network is a new technique with a flexible mathematical structure that is capable of identifying complex non-linear relationships between input and output data when compared to other classical modeling techniques. Johor River Basin located in Johor state, Malaysia, which is significantly degrading due to human activities and development along the river. Accordingly, it is very important to implement and adopt a water quality prediction model that can provide a powerful tool to implement better water resource management. Several modeling methods have been applied in this research including: linear regression models (LRM), multilayer perceptron neural networks and radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NN). The results showed that the use of neural networks and more specifically RBF-NN models can describe the behavior of water quality parameters more accurately than linear regression models. In addition, we observed that the RBF finds a solution faster than the MLP and is the most accurate and most reliable tool in terms of processing large amounts of non-linear, non-parametric data.},

 abstract={This paper examined the efficiency of multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models in prediction of two major water quality parameters in a wastewater treatment plant. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) as well as indirect indicators of organic matters are representative parameters for sewer water quality. Performance of the ANN models was evaluated using coefficient of correlation (r), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias values. The computed values of BOD and COD by model, ANN method and regression analysis were in close agreement with their respective measured values. Results showed that the ANN performance model was better than the MLR model. Comparative indices of the optimized ANN with input values of temperature (T), pH, total suspended solid (TSS) and total suspended (TS) for prediction of BOD was RMSE = 25.1 mg/L, r = 0.83 and for prediction of COD was RMSE = 49.4 mg/L, r = 0.81. It was found that the ANN model could be employed successfully in estimating the BOD and COD in the inlet of wastewater biochemical treatment plants. Moreover, sensitive examination results showed that pH parameter have more effect on BOD and COD predicting to another parameters. Also, both implemented models have predicted BOD better than COD.},

 abstract={The brain often has to make decisions based on information stored in working , but the neural circuitry underlying working is not fully understood. Many theoretical efforts have been focused on modeling the persistent delay period activity in the prefrontal areas that is believed to represent working . Recent experiments reveal that the delay period activity in the prefrontal cortex is neither static nor homogeneous as previously assumed. Models based on reservoir networks have been proposed to model such dynamical activity pattern. The connections between neurons within a reservoir are random and do not require explicit tuning. The information storage does not depend on the stable states of the network. However, it is not clear how the encoded information can be retrieved for decision making using a biologically realistic algorithm. We therefore build a reservoir-based neural network to model the neuronal responses of the prefrontal cortex in a somatosensory delayed discrimination task. We first illustrate that the neurons in the reservoir exhibit heterogeneous and dynamical delay period activity observed in previous experiments. Then we show that a cluster population circuit the information from the reservoir with a winner-take-all mechanism and contributes to the decision making. Finally, we show the model achieves a good performance rapidly by shaping only the readout with reinforcement . Our model reproduces important features of previous and neurophysiology data. We illustrate for the first time how task-specific information stored in a reservoir network can be retrieved with a biologically plausible reinforcement-training scheme.},
