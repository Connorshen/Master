 abstract={Video streaming service in wireless networks is increasingly using dynamic selection of video bit-rates to provide a high quality of user experience (QoE). The bit-rate switching mechanism, performed at client side, plays a key role in determining QoE metrics. In this paper, we present the first analytical framework to compute starvation probability of playout buffer, continuous playback time and mean video quality, given the bit-rate switching logics. Wireless channel is modeled as a continuous time Markov process, and playout buffer is modeled as a fluid queue with Markov modulated fluid arrival. We construct a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to characterize the dynamics of starvation probability and expected continuous playback time with regard to buffer length, and simple models to analyze mean bit-rate for different bit-rate switching algorithms. Our framework is very general in that by adding appropriate parameters, it can be utilized to predict the QoE metrics of dynamic adaptive streaming with a variety of features: i) buffer-aware bit-rate switching ii) (im)patience of the user, and iii) receiver-side flow control.},

 abstract={Today, the technology for video streaming over the Internet is converging towards a paradigm named HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS), which brings two new features. First, by using HTTP/TCP, it leverages network-friendly TCP to achieve both firewall/NAT traversal and bandwidth sharing. Second, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete rate levels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way so that the video encoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom in HAS design is that since the TCP throughput observed by a client would indicate the available network bandwidth, it could be used as a reliable reference for video bitrate selection. We argue that this is no longer true when HAS becomes a substantial fraction of the total network traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients compete at a network bottleneck, the discrete nature of the video bitrates results in difficulty for a client to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and test bed experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation leads to video bitrate oscillation and other undesirable behaviors that negatively impact the video viewing experience. We therefore argue that it is necessary to design at the application layer using a "probe and adapt" principle for video bitrate adaptation (where "probe" refers to trial increment of the data rate, instead of sending auxiliary piggybacking traffic), which is akin, but also orthogonal to the transport-layer TCP congestion control. We present PANDA - a client-side rate adaptation algorithm for HAS - as a practical embodiment of this principle. Our test bed results show that compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the instability of video bitrate selection by over 75% without increasing the risk of buffer underrun.},

 abstract={Dynamic Adaptation Streaming over HTTP (DASH) enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) for users by automatically switching quality levels according to network conditions. Various adaptation schemes have been proposed to select the most suitable quality level during video playback. Adaptation schemes are currently based on the measured TCP throughput received by the video player. Although video buffer can mitigate throughput fluctuations, it does not take into account the effect of the transition of quality levels on the QoE. In this paper, we propose a QoE-aware DASH system (or QDASH) to improve the user-perceived quality of video watching. We integrate available bandwidth measurement into the video data probes with a measurement proxy architecture. We have found that our available bandwidth measurement method facilitates the selection of video quality levels. Moreover, we assess the QoE of the quality transitions by carrying out subjective experiments. Our results show that users prefer a gradual quality change between the best and worst quality levels, instead of an abrupt switching. Hence, we propose a QoE-aware quality adaptation algorithm for DASH based on our findings. Finally, we integrate both network measurement and the QoE-aware quality adaptation into a comprehensive DASH system.},

  year={2003},
 abstract={Layer encoded video is an elegant way to allow adaptive transmissions in the face of varying network conditions as well as it supports heterogeneity in networks and clients. As a drawback quality degradation can occur, caused by variations in the amount of transmitted layers. Recent work on reducing these variations makes assumptions about the perceived quality of those videos. The main goal of this paper respectively its motivation is to investigate the validity of these assumptions by subjective assessment. However, the paper is also an attempt to investigate fundamental issues for the human perception of layer encoded video with time-varying quality characteristics. For this purpose, we built a test environment for the subjective assessment of layer encoded video and conducted an empirical experiment in which 66 test candidates took part. The results of this subjective assessment are presented and discussed. To a large degree we were able to validate existing (unproven) assumptions about quality degradation caused by variations in layer encoded videos, however there were also some interesting, at first sight counterintuitive findings from our experiment.},

 abstract={Abstract:  We consider the problem of optimizing video delivery for a network supporting video clients streaming stored video. Specifically, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing network resource allocation and video quality adaptation. Our objective is to fairly maximize video clients' Quality of Experience (QoE) realizing tradeoffs among the mean quality, temporal variability in quality, and fairness, incorporating user preferences on rebuffering and cost of video delivery. We present a simple asymptotically optimal online algorithm, NOVA, to solve the problem. NOVA is asynchronous, and using minimal communication, distributes the tasks of resource allocation to network controller, and quality adaptation to respective video clients. Video quality adaptation in NOVA is also optimal for standalone video clients, and is well suited for use with DASH framework. Further, we extend NOVA for use with more general QoE models, networks shared with other traffic loads and networks using fixed/legacy resource allocation.},

 keywords={Machine Learning;HTTP Streaming;Rate Adaptation},
 abstract={Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has become an emerging application nowadays. Video rate adaptation is a key to determine the video quality of HTTP-based media streaming. Recent works have proposed several algorithms that allow a DASH client to adapt its video encoding rate to network dynamics. While network conditions are typically affected by many different factors, these algorithms however usually consider only a few representative information, e.g., predicted available bandwidth or fullness of its playback buffer. In addition, the error in bandwidth estimation could significantly degrade their performance. Therefore, this paper presents Machine Learning-based Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MLASH), an elastic framework that exploits a wide range of useful network-related features to train a rate classification model. The distinct properties of MLASH are that its machine learning-based framework can be incorporated with any existing adaptation algorithm and utilize big data characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. We show via trace-based simulations that machine learning-based adaptation can achieve a better performance than traditional adaptation algorithms in terms of their target quality of experience (QoE) metrics.},

 abstract={Adaptive streaming is a promising technique for video streaming service to cope with the quality degradation of mobile users' connections. In this paper we propose a service layer control mechanism for video flows based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm that will gracefully degrade the video quality experienced by the end-user depending on the connection status. Using layered coded videos, the end-user should find the most appropriate quality level for its stream. The adaptive streaming problem can naturally be modeled as a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) because the end-user has partial information about the network state based on the received throughput, but this model cannot be applied on-line during streaming. We propose here an MDP modeling the adaptive streaming problem that can be solved on-line by the Q-Learning algorithm. Both models have identical solutions proving the validity of the proposed MDP model.},

 abstract={In networked video stream mining systems, real-time video contents are captured remotely and, subsequently, encoded and transmitted over bandwidth-constrained networks for classification at the receiver. One key task at the encoder is to adapt its compression on the fly based on time-varying network bandwidth and video characteristics - while attaining low delay and high classification accuracy. In this paper, we formalize the decision at the encoder side as an infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). We employ low-complexity, model-free reinforcement learning schemes to solve this problem efficiently under dynamic and unknown environment. Our proposed scheme adopts the technique of virtual experience (VE) update to drastically speed up convergence over conventional Q-learning, allowing the encoder to react to abrupt network changes on the order of minutes, instead of hours. In comparison to myopic optimization, it consistently achieves higher overall reward and lower sending delay under various network conditions.},

 abstract={Caching and rate allocation are two promising approaches to support video streaming over wireless network. However, existing rate allocation designs do not fully exploit the advantages of the two approaches. This paper investigates the problem of cache-enabled QoE-driven video rate allocation problem. We establish a mathematical model for this problem, and point out that it is difficult to solve the problem with traditional dynamic programming. Then we propose a deep reinforcement learning approaches to solve it. First, we model the problem as a Markov decision problem. Then we present a deep Q-learning algorithm with a special knowledge transfer process to find out effective allocation policy. Finally, numerical results are given to demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively maintain high-quality user experience of mobile user moving among small cells. We also investigate the impact of configuration of critical parameters on the performance of our algorithm.},

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

 abstract={The ever-increasing demand for seamless high-definition video streaming, along with the widespread adoption of the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, has been a major driver of the large amount of research on bitrate adaptation algorithms. The complexity and variability of the video content and of the mobile wireless channel make this an ideal application for learning approaches. Here, we present D-DASH, a framework that combines Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of DASH. Different learning architectures are proposed and assessed, combining feed-forward and recurrent deep neural networks with advanced strategies. D-DASH designs are thoroughly evaluated against prominent algorithms from the state-of-the-art, both heuristic and learning-based, evaluating performance indicators such as image quality across video segments and freezing/rebuffering events. Our numerical results are obtained on real and simulated channel traces and show the superiority of D-DASH in nearly all the considered quality metrics. Besides yielding a considerably higher QoE, the D-DASH framework exhibits faster convergence to the rate-selection strategy than the other learning algorithms considered in the study. This makes it possible to shorten the training phase, making D-DASH a good candidate for client-side runtime learning.},

 abstract={For the purpose of automatic video quality evaluation, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) has been the most well-known full reference quality metric since a long time. Improving on PSNR, several other pixel-based quality metrics have been developed, namely Structural SIMilarity (SSIM), Multi Scale-SSIM (MS-SSIM), and Video Quality Metric (VQM). The goal of these objective video quality metrics is to replace time-consuming and expensive subjective quality assessment experiments. These alternative objective metrics have already been evaluated on several video compression schemes, such as MPEG-2 and H. 264/AVC, transported over different kinds of network protocols and under a large variation of network characteristics. In January 2013, the successor of the Advanced Video Coding (H. 264/AVC) standard, named High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), has been finalized. Although HEVC is still a block based hybrid video compression standard, some radical changes are made to subjectively improve the compression efficiency compared to H. 264/AVC. Until now, the alternative quality metrics have never been evaluated on this new compression scheme. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the difference in performance of these full reference metrics. Based on subjective evaluations, a performance analysis is presented which shows the validity of these models when applied to HEVC compressed video content. I. INTRODUCTION},

 abstract={Video communication has a very important role nowadays. Also very efficient video coding techniques are developed in order to provide high quality video streams using all the available bandwidth. In this work we perform a comparison between three different video codecs: the ITU-T H.264, an improved ITU-T H.264 version including the AIF (adaptive interpolation filter), and the AVS (audio and video coding standard) that is the Chinese standard video codec. The realized tests involve eight standard video sequences that are coded end decoded using the mentioned standards. Then, for each sequence we evaluate the video quality using four objective metrics: PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio), VQM (video quality metric), SSIM (structural similarity), and the HSM (HVS-human visual system-similarity measure). While PSNR and VQM take into account the mathematical features of the video sequences, SSIM and HSM are based on the HVS theory. So it is possible to evaluate also the human eye perceived quality. The realized analysis is related to the relationship between the bitrate and the quality indexes. The conclusions of our analysis can give an evaluation about several codec performances and can be useful for developers to plan and manage their network. Also, taking into account the HSM scores, the AVS has better performance than the ITU-T video codecs.},

 abstract={The exponential growth of video traffic in mobile networks calls for the deployment of advanced video admission control (VAC) and resource management (RM) techniques in order to provide the best quality of experience (QoE) to the end user according to the available network resources. The degradation of the QoE perceived by the user when reducing the source rate of a video typically depends on the content of the video itself. In this paper, we analyzed the QoE of a group of test video sequences encoded with H.264 advanced video codec at different rates, i.e., quality levels. The QoE is objectively expressed in terms of the average structural similarity (SSIM) index. Based on empirical results, we propose a 4-degree polynomial approximation of the SSIM as a function of the coded video rate. We hence propose to tag each video with these polynomial coefficients that provide a compact description of its specific SSIM behavior, and to use this information in VAC and RM algorithms to optimally manage a shared transmission medium. As a proof of concept, we report selected simulation results that compare QoE-aware and QoE-agnostic algorithms in a scenario with a single link shared by multiple concurrent video flows.},
